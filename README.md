Project Desciption : We made a 3D model of 2041 Khulna University.It is a 3D game Where user can walk and see what's around.We Used Blender to create 2D model.Then we made 3D model using Blender-osm.We used unreal engine to make it more realistic.But we faced problem doing so,as unreal engine doesn't support texturing.We managed to do texturing by our own.This project will show you how we want to see our Khulna University in 2041.
